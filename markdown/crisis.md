    *   **Reported Impact:** Potential leakage of personal information from survey responses stored in the system and from direct messages on the official X (formerly Twitter) account associated with the event. Affected individuals were contacted individually [8].
    *   **Public Response & Actions:** JVCKENWOOD announced the incident and the potential data exposure, linking it to the previously reported YouTube channel hijacking. They conducted an investigation and notified affected individuals [8].
    *   **Stated Lessons Learned/Changes:** JVCKENWOOD reported it will continue to work with external expert organizations to improve its ability to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents and prevent recurrence [8].

### Stated Approach to Technology-Related Crisis Management and Digital Resilience:

*   **Frameworks, Plans, and Teams:**
    *   JVCKENWOOD has established a **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)**, known as **JKC-CSIRT**, under the control of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) [5, 16]. JKC-CSIRT is responsible for promoting information security incident response and strengthening security across the entire JVCKENWOOD Group [2].
    *   The company also mentions a **Factory Security Incident Response Team (FSIRT)**, indicating specific response capabilities for production environments [1, 19].
    *   For product security, a **PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team)** operation is in place [16].
    *   These teams were established to enable early response and strengthen collaboration with external parties, recognizing the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks [2].
    *   A **"Company-wide Information Security Committee"** chaired by the CISO is held regularly. This committee monitors the development and operational status of information security management and implements necessary measures [16].
*   **Stated Strategies for Digital Resilience:**
    *   JVCKENWOOD states it implements measures such as IT security system construction, data protection/preservation, and employee training/education [1, 16].
    *   The company aims to prevent risks like information leakage, tampering, and destruction through human, organizational, and technical measures [2].
    *   Specific technical measures mentioned include consolidating servers and conducting training exercises against targeted external attacks [16].
    *   In response to incidents, they employ measures like server isolation, analysis, strengthening security, and installing new intrusion detection systems [1, 19].
    *   For supply chain resilience, which can be impacted by digital disruptions, measures include securing development backups, multiple suppliers, holding BCP inventory, and adopting general-purpose parts [5].

### Stated Strategy for Business Continuity Planning (BCP) for Digital Systems:

*   JVCKENWOOD has been formally developing its Group-wide BCP framework since 2010 and obtained Japan's "Resilience Certification" in 2017, with subsequent renewals (including 2025), indicating ongoing BCP efforts [22].
*   The company states its BCP basic policy is to "contribute to the safety and security of society through the continuation of business by promptly restoring business activities after the occurrence of an emergency situation" [22].
*   BCPs are formulated envisioning various incidents, including those that could impact IT systems like cyberattacks or other emergencies [5, 9, 12].
*   While specific RTOs (Recovery Time Objectives) or RPOs (Recovery Point Objectives) for digital assets are not publicly detailed in the provided sources, the general concepts are relevant to BCP [3, 9, 10, 11, 12]. JVCKENWOOD's BCP activities include regular reviews, education, and conducting drills based on emergency scenarios [22].
*   The company utilizes external data centers and cloud services (like NEC Cloud IaaS) for key systems, which can contribute to BCP by providing resilient infrastructure and potentially faster recovery options [17]. This includes measures for securing backups [5, 17].
*   BCP is considered in contexts like professional radio systems deployment for crisis management and business continuity needs [23, 26].

### Roles, Responsibilities, and Governance Structures:

*   The **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)** holds ultimate responsibility for the Group's risk management system [5].
*   A **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** oversees the information security system, including the JKC-CSIRT [5, 16]. The CISO chairs the "Company-wide Information Security Committee" [16].
*   The **Board of Directors** receives reports on the status of responses to identified important risks (including information security) and provides appropriate management and supervision [5].
*   An **executive officer** is appointed as the responsible person for managing important risks, including information security enhancement [5].
*   The **Information Security Committee** operates under the CISO, handling activities like risk assessments and monitoring management system operation [16].
*   Specific **security directors** at relevant locations work with CSIRT and FSIRT in response to incidents [1, 19].
*   Risk management involves identifying "global important risks," designating responsible officers, and formulating company-wide countermeasures at the management level [5].

## 2. General Discussion:

Based *only* on the publicly available information presented above, JVCKENWOOD demonstrates a structured approach to digital crisis management and business continuity, though transparency on specific internal procedures and the effectiveness of past responses remains limited. The company has established dedicated teams like JKC-CSIRT, FSIRT, and PSIRT, operating under a CISO and overseen by executive management and the Board of Directors, indicating a formal governance structure for cybersecurity and incident response [2, 5, 16, 19]. This structure, along with stated commitments to employee training, system security enhancements, and regular risk assessments, suggests a degree of preparedness [1, 5, 16]. Furthermore, JVCKENWOOD's long-term engagement with BCP, evidenced by its Resilience Certification renewals since 2017, points to a strategic focus on operational resilience that extends to potential digital disruptions [22]. The company explicitly acknowledges the need to respond to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and collaborates with external specialists, particularly following incidents, to improve response capabilities and prevent recurrence [1, 2, 8, 19]. However, the occurrence of significant incidents within the last five years, including a ransomware attack impacting European operations and unauthorized access events affecting subsidiaries in Thailand and a specific event's digital platform, highlights the persistent challenges in mitigating cyber risks [6, 1, 8]. While JVCKENWOOD publicly communicated these incidents and outlined response steps like system isolation, investigation, and enhanced security measures, detailed information on the root causes, the full impact (especially concerning data confirmed as exfiltrated in the 2021 incident), and specific, lasting changes implemented as 'lessons learned' beyond general commitments is scarce in public disclosures [1, 6, 8, 13, 19]. For a Japanese corporate strategy audience assessing JVCKENWOOD, the established governance framework and dedicated response teams (CSIRT/FSIRT/PSIRT) are positive indicators of organizational commitment to digital risk management [2, 5, 16]. The company's proactive BCP certification also signals a focus on resilience [22]. Nevertheless, the recent incidents underscore the ongoing vulnerability to cyber threats common across industries. The lack of public detail on BCP specifics like RTOs/RPOs for critical digital systems and limited disclosure on concrete post-incident adaptations might be perceived as areas lacking transparency, potentially impacting a full assessment of their digital risk posture and response effectiveness for partnership or competitive evaluation purposes.
