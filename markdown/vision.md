## 1. Company Vision and Strategy Elements:

### Vision/Purpose/Mission Statement:

*   **Corporate Philosophy (Re-defined from previous Vision):** "Creating excitement and peace of mind for the people of the world." [10, 15, 30]
*   **Core Message:** JVCKENWOOD aims to provide both inspiration ("excitement") and reliability/safety ("peace of mind") globally through its products, services, and technologies (audio, visual, communications). [15, 17, 30] This philosophy is the fundamental belief guiding the group's actions and is shared with all stakeholders. [16, 30] The company aims to enhance long-term corporate value based on this philosophy. [3, 17, 30] A new corporate philosophy symbol was established (effective April 1, 2025) to represent this philosophy globally and foster internal unity. [3, 17, 30]

### Strategic Vision Components/Pillars:

JVCKENWOOD's strategic direction is primarily outlined in its medium-term management plan, **"VISION 2025"** (starting fiscal 2023, ending fiscal 2025). [1, 7] This plan strengthens the basic strategy of the previous plan ("VISION 2023"), which was "Change for Growth." [1, 7, 26]

The core components/pillars of VISION 2025 revolve around **Maximizing Corporate Value** through:
*   **Basic Strategy - "Change for Growth" (Evolved):** Accelerating growth momentum by optimizing the business portfolio and capital allocation. [1, 26] This involves strengthening the revenue base of existing businesses and expanding growth businesses. [19, 25]
*   **Business Portfolio Optimization:** Allocating resources based on medium-term business growth potential and capital efficiency to achieve an optimal business portfolio transformation by fiscal 2025. [1] This includes strengthening the Communications Systems Business as a growth driver. [15, 20, 26]
*   **Financial Strategy:** Improving capital efficiency with an emphasis on the cost of capital and executing balanced capital allocation for growth investments (including strengthening the management base) and strategic investments (new businesses, shareholder returns, debt repayment). [1] The focus is on generating operating cash flow for profit growth to achieve a return on capital exceeding the cost of capital. [1]
*   **Sustainability Strategy:** Promoting sustainability management based on "profitable growth" and "solving social issues on a global scale" to enhance corporate value. [1, 28] This involves contributing to a sustainable society through business activities. [5, 10, 28]

### Vision Measures / KPIs:

JVCKENWOOD has set the following financial targets for **Fiscal Year 2025 (ending March 2026)** under VISION 2025: [1, 2, 11]

| KPI                                                | Target for FY2025 | Notes                                     |

| Price-to-Book Ratio (PBR)                          | > 1.0             | Aim to achieve as soon as possible [1]    |

*(Note: FY2023 refers to the fiscal year ending March 2024. FY2025 refers to the fiscal year ending March 2026. Currency is Japanese Yen (¥) unless otherwise specified.)* [11]

The previous plan, "VISION 2023," had its KPIs achieved ahead of schedule in fiscal 2022 (ended March 2023). [1, 7, 32]

### Stakeholder Focus:

JVCKENWOOD's vision and strategy documents explicitly mention the importance of engaging with and meeting the expectations of various stakeholders:
*   **General Stakeholder Mention:** The corporate philosophy aims to share richness and value with "all our stakeholders." [30] The company emphasizes building trust through engagement with stakeholders including customers, business partners, shareholders/investors, employees, local communities, and external partners (governments, NGOs, other companies). [1, 6] The new corporate philosophy symbol aims for instant recognition by "all stakeholders." [3, 17]
*   **Customers:** The management principles include "Creating value through Monozukuri (manufacturing)," implying customer focus. [16, 30] Specific business strategies aim to provide products/services meeting customer needs (e.g., in professional radio systems). [15]
*   **Shareholders/Investors:** Maximizing corporate and shareholder value is a core goal of VISION 2025. [1] Financial strategies focus on capital efficiency, return on capital, and shareholder returns (Total Payout Ratio target). [1, 21] Stable profit distribution is considered a key management issue. [1]
*   **Society/Environment:** The Sustainability Strategy aims to solve social issues globally and contribute to a sustainable society. [1, 5, 10, 28] Achieving SDGs is considered a most important management issue. [19] The philosophy mentions contributing to "peace of mind," which includes safety and security aspects relevant to society. [15, 28]
*   **Employees:** Management principles include "investing in people to drive innovation" and building a supportive corporate culture. [16, 25, 30] Initiatives like the Value Creation Square aim to establish flexible work environments and promote work style reform. [20, 26] Fostering a sense of unity among employees is also a goal. [17]
*   **Partners:** Collaboration with external business partners is highlighted as important for innovation and business development. [6, 9, 15]

## 2. General Discussion:

Based solely on the information presented above regarding JVCKENWOOD's formally communicated strategy, the company's vision centers on delivering "excitement and peace of mind" globally, underpinned by the medium-term plan "VISION 2025." This plan evolves the previous "Change for Growth" strategy, sharpening the focus on maximizing corporate value through optimized business portfolios and capital allocation, driven by financial efficiency and sustainability management. The vision appears clear in its dual focus on emotional engagement ("excitement") and reliability ("peace of mind"), relevant to its diverse product range from consumer electronics to professional systems. The strategic pillars—portfolio optimization, financial discipline (targeting returns above capital cost), and sustainability—demonstrate internal coherence, linking operational adjustments directly to overarching value creation goals. The ambition is evident in the specific financial targets set for FY2025, such as achieving stable 10% ROE, >9% ROIC, and PBR above 1.0, signifying a drive towards improved profitability and market valuation, building on the early achievement of the previous plan's KPIs. The alignment between the vision and its measures seems robust; the KPIs directly track progress towards enhanced capital efficiency (ROE, ROIC, D/E ratio), shareholder value (Payout Ratio, PBR), and overall profitable growth (Revenue, Profit Margin), which are central tenets of maximizing corporate value under VISION 2025. For a Japanese strategic audience, JVCKENWOOD's vision presents a familiar emphasis on long-term value and stakeholder contribution, common in Japanese corporate philosophy, but combines it with a clear, quantitatively measured focus on capital efficiency and portfolio optimization ("Change for Growth") that reflects a pragmatic approach to navigating global market shifts and enhancing competitiveness, aiming for a status described as an "excellent company" combining strength and resilience. The explicit inclusion of sustainability as a core strategic pillar, linked to both profitable growth and solving global social issues, aligns with increasing global and domestic expectations for ESG integration.
