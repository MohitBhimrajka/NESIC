## 2. General Discussion:

Based solely on the provided quotes from CEO Shoichiro Eguchi, JVCKENWOOD's strategic outlook is firmly anchored in the "VISION 2025" medium-term plan, prioritizing "Change for Growth" to maximize corporate value. The core message revolves around adaptation, portfolio optimization, and strengthening foundational pillars. Eguchi consistently emphasizes the need for flexibility and speed in responding to a rapidly changing business environment, viewing adaptability as crucial for survival and sustained success against emerging competition. A key element of this strategy involves optimizing the business portfolio based on market attractiveness and capital efficiency, explicitly positioning the Communications Systems Business as the primary profit driver. This suggests a strategic focus on leveraging existing strengths in professional radio systems, particularly in North America's public safety sector, while potentially de-emphasizing or restructuring less profitable areas. The strategy encompasses business, financial, and sustainability dimensions, aiming to improve earning power, strengthen the financial position (targeting stable ROE above 10% and PBR over 1.0), and promote ESG management, reflecting a holistic approach to long-term value creation and achieving the ambition of becoming a "100-year company". Eguchi also highlights the importance of brand equity (JVC, KENWOOD, Victor), considering trust and quality assurance as vital intangible assets to be maintained and enhanced. For a Japanese audience, Eguchi's leadership communicates a blend of traditional values (brand strength, long-term vision) with a clear imperative for decisive change and strategic resource allocation towards high-growth, high-efficiency areas, acknowledging the need to evolve beyond historical business models. The tone is determined and forward-looking, acknowledging market challenges while expressing confidence in the strategic direction and the company's ability to adapt and thrive.
